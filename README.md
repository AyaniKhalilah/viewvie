# Viewvie!


Do an ```npm install``` after every pull!

Run

```npm run start-all``` 

from the 'viewvie' directory to start the application. : )

Run

```npm run clear-media```

from the 'backend' directory to clear all uploads and output (it can get overwhelming).

Of course, project is missing .env file with Pinecone API key.
