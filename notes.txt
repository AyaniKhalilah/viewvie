- hey guys
- please read
- if you want
- (i want you to)
- in package.json directly in backend directory, type is set to COMMONJS (require statements)
- this is for microservices files
- in database directory, it is set to MODULE (import statements)
- just something to bear in mind
- embedder file should actually probably be in database because of this.
- files between modules and database dont actually interact
- i should totes fix this eventually where microservices has its own package.json
- eventually..

- 😝
- output file is in gitignore because it can get very large and is often deleted and recreated
- instructions to clear output are in video splitter file

- eventually endpoint of backend to return to front end will be a single string =)
- a few functions will have an optional parameter of metadata (probably an object : {"movieName" : "Fight Club"})
- so that overall system flow can be used for admin and user
- admin -> upload video -> beep bop *gear sounds* -> uploaded to backend WITH metadata
- user -> upload video -> beep bop *softer gear sounds* -> This movie is Fight Club! (metadata is not necessary)
